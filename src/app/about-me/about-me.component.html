                        My journey begins with an apprenticeship as a <a href="https://dominik-graf.developerakademie.net/polymech_galerie/index.html" target="_blank">Polymechanic EFZ.</a> Two years after my apprenticeship, I wanted to continue my education
                        and was not resourceful at first. On June 2022, however, I started an online training course to become a Front End Developer, which I feel very good about and offers a lot of room for growth.</p>
